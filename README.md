To create a comprehensive `README.md` file for your GitHub repository, I'll need details about your project. Based on your "Web Server Log Analyzer" project, here's a sample `README.md`. You can adapt it to match the specific contents of your uploaded file.

# Web Server Log Analyzer

A powerful tool for analyzing web server logs to track traffic patterns, detect security threats, and visualize critical insights. This project leverages Python, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit to deliver robust log analysis and visualizations.

## Features

- **Log Validation**: Ensure uploaded log files match the required format.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Visualize requests over time, HTTP status code distributions, and endpoint usage.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Detect potential brute force attacks based on failed login attempts.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore data using rich and intuitive Streamlit-powered dashboards.
- **CSV Report Generation**: Summarize analysis in downloadable CSV files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `streamlit`

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/web-server-log-analyzer.git
   cd web-server-log-analyzer
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Upload your log file (in `.log` format) via the provided interface.
4. Explore traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and generate reports.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file.
- `utils/`: Contains helper modules for log validation, parsing, analysis, and visualization.
- `temp/`: Temporary storage for uploaded files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.

## Visualizations

- **Requests Over Time**: Understand traffic trends with time-series visualizations.
- **HTTP Status Code Distribution**: View the frequency of different status codes.
- **Endpoint Access**: Discover the most frequently accessed endpoints.
- **Failed Login Heatmap**: Identify patterns in failed login attempts.
